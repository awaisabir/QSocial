# QSocial

A full Javascript stack I am creating to help me practice advanced concepts in modern JS technologies. Users will be able to perform CRUD operations on posts, comments, profiles (admins), all together with having their security in mind! This app will be accompanied by a React Native app as well (soon) ...

Tech being used are:

- Express.js
- Passport.js
- Mongoose
- JWT Authorization
- Cloudinary API

- React.js
- React Router
- Redux
- SematicUI

--------

## Current Status :nut_and_bolt: :zap: :hammer:

### Backend

- Need to complete the Posts API, and paginate one of the endpoints.
- Trying to create more endpoints for the API.

### Frontend

- Need to set up a proper Container that checks token validity before rendering routes.
- Need to add more complexity to the Profile Page.
- Need to set up a Posts page.
